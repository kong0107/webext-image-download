# Image Download

browser extension to download images in the current webpage

Firefox is not supported yet.

For supported sites, images are downloaded and rename to a good-to-trace-back format. For example, filename `twitter+Twitter+1435987777028493313+1.jpg` means it is the 1st image of the tweet https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1435987777028493313. The formats vary for different sites.

For sites not supported, this extension still tries to download all images in main part of the page, including background images. This may download too many images that you do not want.
